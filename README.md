# Sprint 4 Project

Hello and Welcome to my first Github Project!

Here is the URL to my Web App: https://sprint4-project-2g22.onrender.com

To get started, let me walk you through the details of this project. 

This project is a web-based application designed to replicate random occurrences through diverse methods and libraries. It offers visual representations and interactive features for investigating and interpreting the generated data that we extracted from the Vehicles US dataframe.

The purpose of this project is to explore the Vehicles market in the United States.
We are also aiming to know more about the US customer's preferences in reference to vehicles.
The dataframe was provided as an excel document: vehicles_us.csv
The dataframe was cleaned by using dropping methods such as duplicates and filling out missing values.
We also discribed the dataframe and provided an info of it and discovered the datatypes.
New column were added to give mroe precise data analysis.
Moving forward we were able to make useful calculations to helps us have better data exploratory and visualization.
There is a total of 16 figures in the webpage such as Plotly Express Histogram, Scatterplot, Histograms, Checkbox, Bar Graph, Pie Chart, Violin Charts and more!
In addition, there was a hypothesis test to figure out if the average prices of vehicle run on gas and electricity is significantly different or not.
Each code was provide with it's respective suitable comment.
Each result is explained in the markdown section.
We paid a lot of attention to having an organized and clear web page.
